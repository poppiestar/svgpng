Just messing around with various grunt modules to build a SVG -> PNG workflow to use in a current project, so sprites can be referenced easily within SASS/SCSS.

The point of this workflow is to take a folder of SVG files, optimise them, rasterise them into PNG images and then output two SCSS map files that can be referenced.
